# Advent of Code 2021 C# Solutions

The goal of this repository is to provide two (2) C# solutions - Part I, Part II - to the daily problems of the Advent of Code coding challenge. 

## What is Advent of Code?

During the month of December, Eric Wastl (http://was.tl/), hosts an "Advent Calendar" challenge. Each day from December 1 - December 25 a two-part daily coding challenge is released. They are fun, tell a cohesive(ish) story, and allow the participants to use any laguage to solve the problem - generally entering two values.

## Why this Repo?

Because the challenge is language agnostic, it's not always easy to get help or solutions in your given language. Plus it's always fun to see how others approach the same problem and resolve it. And even though the challenges are "live" December 1-25, they are available to start/finish anytime after release. So even though we're still working out 2021 solutions, someone might just be starting.

## Why Should I Contribute / How Does this Help the Engineering Community?

The answer is two-fold: First, we don't want new software engineers to get frustrated and quit. Second, we want to provide examples of solid programming principles.
